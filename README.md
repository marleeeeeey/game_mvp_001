## Guidelines

### Godot editor guidelines

- Use push_error and push_warning for errors and warnings.
- Edotor Settings -> General -> Debug -> Auto Switch to Remote Scene Tree - ENABLE.
- Project Settings -> Display -> Window -> Always on Top - ENABLE.
- Use `Scene -> Save Branch As Scene` to simplify the scene and reuse it.

### File structure

The project is structured in a way that allows to easily reuse common scenes and tilesets across multiple projects. This approach will teach you to create convenient components for future games.

The structure is as follows:

```
- GodotProjectFoler
  - common (reusable scenes, tilesets)
	- tileset_[sqr|iso|hex]_<name> (reusable tileset)
	  - *.tres
	  - *.png
	- scene_<name> (reusable scene)
	  - *.tres
	  - *.gd
	  - *.tscn
	  - art/
		- *.png
		- *.mp3
	- sfx_<name> (reusable sound effect)
	  - art/
		- *.mp3
		- *.wav
	  - <name>_sfx.tres
  - this (game specific scenes, scripts and art)
	- main.tscn
	- main.gd
	- <name>.tscn
	- <name>.gd
	- art
	  - *.png
	  - *.mp3
	  - *.wav
```

**sqr** - square tileset.
**iso** - isometric tileset.
**hex** - hexagonal tileset.
